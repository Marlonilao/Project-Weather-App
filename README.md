Weather App

This project is based on The Odin Projectâ€™s Weather App lesson. It is built to practice asynchronous JavaScript using Promises and async/await. The main goal is to learn how to work with APIs, fetch and handle data using the Fetch API, and display the results in a clean and efficient way.
